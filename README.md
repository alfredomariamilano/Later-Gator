# Later-Gator
**Later Gator** is a mobile app that I produced with a few friends from General Assembly as
part of a 24hr hackathon.

It is an app for people who are keen to either travel or move abroad, allowing users to randomly shuffle through various cities around the world to determine the best place for them to go. Using the Nomad List API, the app gives essential information for each location, including the quality of the nightlife and the price of beer and coffee (with prices translated from USD to GBP using the Fixer API).

It was built using the Ionic framework.
